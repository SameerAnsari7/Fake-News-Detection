## Project Overview

Fake news has become a critical issue in the age of digital information. The proliferation of misleading and false information can have severe consequences, leading to misinformation and mistrust in media. This project aims to build a simple fake news detection system using machine learning techniques to help users identify potential fake news articles.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a preprocessed collection of news articles labeled as either "fake" or "genuine." The data was sourced from reliable news platforms and verified for authenticity before being labeled and preprocessed for machine learning purposes.

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter notebook and execute the code, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using `pip` with the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SameerAnsari7/Fake-News-Detection
.git
cd Fake-News-Detection
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `fake_news_detection.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the fake news detection model and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The project's results will be available in the `fake_news_detection.ipynb` notebook. The notebook includes details about data exploration, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve and expand this simple fake news detection project are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request, explaining the changes and the motivation behind them.

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading my first Project Repository in Github! I'm still new to Data Science Industry so I would like to apologize if there are any mistakes that I have made in my coding in notebook and I really want to apply my knowledge with my Marketing Degree and Data Science in order to have good Insights and expand my career to other Business Cases.
